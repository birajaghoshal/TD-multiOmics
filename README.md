# TD-multiOmics
Tensor Based unsupervised feature extraction was applied to multiomics data which was used for performance evaluation of DAIBLO algorithm implemented in mixOmics pacage

#Introduction
Recently, I poposed multi-view data analysis strategy using tensor based unsupervised feature extraction ([paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28841719)), and applied it to multi-omics data among them. However, because there is no multi-omics in the title, I feel that I am pretty defeated by the appealing power to the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005752) of the recent [mixOmics package](http://mixomics.org/) which emphasized this point. Therefore, I would like to compare the performance when applying the variable selection multi-view data application by unsupervised learning using tensor decomposition to the dataset whose performance is tried with mixOmics as well as the propagation of own method.
